This folder is your "data" folder.  
It should be renamed from "AAA_sample to a three-letter acronym for your region 
(e.g. ALB for Albany county culverts)

Include the following information in this folder before running the model:
1) A csv file containing field data for culverts using he same acronym 
(e.g. ALB.csv).  The file called AAA_sample.csv shows the requird field columns

2) A csv file containing precip information for your region (e.g. ALB_precip.csv). 
You can get precipitation data from NRCC (http://precip.eas.cornell.edu/)
